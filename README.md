# Flight-Delay-Prediction-with-Real-Time-Weather-Data
This project builds a scalable data pipeline that integrates flight data with real-time weather observations and forecasts to predict potential flight delays. It leverages Apache Kafka for streaming, PySpark for data processing and machine learning, and Dash/Plotly for interactive visualization
